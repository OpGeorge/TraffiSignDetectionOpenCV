# Traffic Sign Detection OpenCV Image Processing


## Description
This project aims to detect traffic sign using traditional image processing methods and algorithms such as Canny Edge detection, color-based detection, shapes detection, Douglas-Peucker's algorithm. The results are satisfying, given the fact that the images contain noises, are bad quality, but image preprocessing (apllying filters, contrast enhancement), can make a major difference overall.
The project uses images from traffic signs datastes at [Kaggle.com road sign detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/road-sign-detection).


## Usage

- The program first offers the user the posibility to choose what algorithm to use on a given image.
- Then the user needs to select the image that is to be processed.
- Finally, the result will be an aproximation of the category in which the sign comes from, and also a copy of the original image where the road sign placement is highlated.

There are below expermiental results obtained by using the traffic sign detection pipeline.
